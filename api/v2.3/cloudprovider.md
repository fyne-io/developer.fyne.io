```go
type CloudProvider interface {
	// ProviderDescription returns a more detailed description of this cloud provider.
	ProviderDescription() string

	ProviderIcon() Resource
	// ProviderName returns the name of this cloud provider, usually the name of the service it uses.

	// Cleanup is called when this provider is no longer used and should be disposed.
	// This is guaranteed to execute before a new provider is `Setup`
	Cleanup(App)
