```go
import "fyne.io/fyne/v2"
```

## Usage

#### type WidgetRenderer

```go
type WidgetRenderer interface {
	// Destroy is for internal use.
	Destroy()
	// Layout is a hook that is called if the widget needs to be laid out.
	// This should never call Refresh.
	Layout(Size)
	// MinSize returns the minimum size of the widget that is rendered by this renderer.
	MinSize() Size
	// Objects returns all objects that should be drawn.
	Objects() []CanvasObject
	// Refresh is a hook that is called if the widget has updated and needs to be redrawn.
	// This might trigger a Layout.
	Refresh()
}
```

WidgetRenderer defines the behaviour of a widget's implementation. This is returned from a widget's declarative object through the CreateRenderer() function and should be exactly one instance per widget in memory.
