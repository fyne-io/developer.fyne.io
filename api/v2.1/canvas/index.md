# canvas
---
```go
import "fyne.io/fyne/v2/canvas"
```

Package canvas contains all of the primitive CanvasObjects that make up a Fyne GUI

The types implemented in this package are used as building blocks in order to build higher order functionality. These types are designed to be non-interactive, by design. If additional functonality is required, it's usually a sign that this type should be used as part of a custom Widget.

## Usage

```go
const (
	// DurationStandard is the time a standard interface animation will run.
	//
	// Since: 2.0
	DurationStandard = time.Millisecond * 300
	// DurationShort is the time a subtle or small transition should use.
	//
	// Since: 2.0
	DurationShort = time.Millisecond * 150
)
```

#### func  NewColorRGBAAnimation

```go
func NewColorRGBAAnimation(start, stop color.Color, d time.Duration, fn func(color.Color)) *fyne.Animation
```
NewColorRGBAAnimation sets up a new animation that will transition from the start to stop Color over the specified Duration. The colour transition will move linearly through the RGB colour space. The content of fn should apply the color values to an object and refresh it. You should call Start() on the returned animation to start it.


<div class="since">Since: <code>
2.0</code></div>

#### func  NewPositionAnimation

```go
func NewPositionAnimation(start, stop fyne.Position, d time.Duration, fn func(fyne.Position)) *fyne.Animation
```
NewPositionAnimation sets up a new animation that will transition from the start to stop Position over the specified Duration. The content of fn should apply the position value to an object for the change to be visible. You should call Start() on the returned animation to start it.


<div class="since">Since: <code>
2.0</code></div>

#### func  NewSizeAnimation

```go
func NewSizeAnimation(start, stop fyne.Size, d time.Duration, fn func(fyne.Size)) *fyne.Animation
```
NewSizeAnimation sets up a new animation that will transition from the start to stop Size over the specified Duration. The content of fn should apply the size value to an object for the change to be visible. You should call Start() on the returned animation to start it.


<div class="since">Since: <code>
2.0</code></div>

#### func  Refresh

```go
func Refresh(obj fyne.CanvasObject)
```
Refresh instructs the containing canvas to refresh the specified obj.
