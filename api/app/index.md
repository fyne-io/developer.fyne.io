Package app provides app implementations for working with Fyne graphical
interfaces. The fastest way to get started is to call app.New() which will
normally load a new desktop application. If the "ci" tag is passed to go (go run
-tags ci myapp.go) it will run an in-memory application.

## Usage

#### func  New

```go
func New() fyne.App
```
New returns a new application instance with the default driver and no unique ID

#### func  NewAppWithDriver

```go
func NewAppWithDriver(d fyne.Driver, id string) fyne.App
```
NewAppWithDriver initialises a new Fyne application using the specified driver
and returns a handle to that App. The id should be globally unique to this app
Built in drivers are provided in the "driver" package. Deprecated: Developers
should not specify a driver manually but use NewAppWithID()

#### func  NewWithID

```go
func NewWithID(id string) fyne.App
```
NewWithID returns a new app instance using the test (headless) driver. The ID
string should be globally unique to this app.
