Each of the following icons is available via the `theme` package as a function. 
For example `theme.InfoIcon()`.

The icons are also available via their source icon name by using the `ThemeIconName` 
with the `Icon` method on a struct implementing `fyne.Theme`. For example `theme.Icon(theme.IconNameInfo)`.

## List

{% include iconlist.html %}

## Using other color sets

Each icon can be used as a source for a particular themed color using the various public helper methods:

* `NewDisabledThemedResource`
* `NewErrorThemedResource`
* `NewInvertedThemedResource`
* `NewPrimaryThemedResource`

By default, all icons adapt to the current theme foreground using `NewThemedResource`
which uses the theme foreground color. All Icons are SVG `width="24"`, `height="24"`.
