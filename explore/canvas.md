In Fyne a `Canvas` is the area which an application is drawn within.
Each window has a canvas which you can access with `Window.Canvas()`
but usually you will find functions on `Window` that avoid accessing
the canvas.

Everything that can be drawn in Fyne is a type of `CanvasObject`.
The example here opens a new window and then shows different types of
primitive graphical element by setting the content of the window canvas.
There are many ways that each type of object can be customised as
shown with the text and circle examples.

As well as changing the content shown using `Canvas.SetContent()` it is
possible to change the content that is currently visible. If, for example, you
change the `FillColour` of a rectangle you can request a refresh of this
existing component using `rect.Refresh()`.

```go
package main

import (
	"image/color"
	"time"

	"fyne.io/fyne/v2"
	"fyne.io/fyne/v2/app"
	"fyne.io/fyne/v2/canvas"
)

func main() {
	myApp := app.New()
	myWindow := myApp.NewWindow("Canvas")
	myCanvas := myWindow.Canvas()

	blue := color.NRGBA{R: 0, G: 0, B: 180, A: 255}
	rect := canvas.NewRectangle(blue)
	myCanvas.SetContent(rect)

	go func() {
		time.Sleep(time.Second)
		green := color.NRGBA{R: 0, G: 180, B: 0, A: 255}
		rect.FillColor = green
		rect.Refresh()
	}()

	myWindow.Resize(fyne.NewSize(100, 100))
	myWindow.ShowAndRun()
}
```

We can draw many different drawing elements in the same way, such as circle and text.

```go
func setContentToText(c fyne.Canvas) {
	green := color.NRGBA{R: 0, G: 180, B: 0, A: 255}
	text := canvas.NewText("Text", green)
	text.TextStyle.Bold = true
	myCanvas.SetContent(text)
}

func setContentToCircle(c fyne.Canvas) {
	red := color.NRGBA{R: 0xff, G: 0x33, B: 0x33, A: 0xff}
	circle := canvas.NewCircle(color.White)
	circle.StrokeWidth = 4
	circle.StrokeColor = red
	c.SetContent(circle)
}
```

## Widget

A `fyne.Widget` is a special type of canvas object that has interactive elements
associated with it. In widgets the logic is separate from the way that
it looks (also called the `WidgetRenderer`).

Widgets are also types of `CanvasObject` and so we can set the
content of our window to a single widget. See how we create a new
`widget.Entry` and set it as the content of the window in this example.

```go
package main

import (
	"fyne.io/fyne/v2/app"
	"fyne.io/fyne/v2/widget"
)

func main() {
	myApp := app.New()
	myWindow := myApp.NewWindow("Widget")

	myWindow.SetContent(widget.NewEntry())
	myWindow.ShowAndRun()
}
```
