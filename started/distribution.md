title: Distributing to App Stores	

order: 60

Packaging a graphical app as described in the [Packaging](/started/packaging)
page provides a file or bundle that could be directly shared or distributed.
However signing and uploading to app stores and market places is an additional
step that requires platform-specific configuration, which we will cover in this
page.

In each of these steps we will use a new tool that is part of the fyne command
line utilities. The `fyne release` step handles the signing and preparation
for each store, but the parameters vary per-platform, which we see below.
