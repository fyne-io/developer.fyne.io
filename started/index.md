## Getting Started
---

Using the Fyne toolkit to build cross platform applications is very simple but does require some tools to be installed before you can begin. If your computer is set up for development with Go then the following steps may not be required, but we advise reading the tips for your operating system just in case. If later steps in this tutorial fail then you should re-visit the prerequisites below.

## Prerequisites

Fyne requires 3 basic elements to be present, the Go tools (at least version 1.12), a C compiler (to connect with system graphics drivers) and an system graphics driver. The instructions vary depending on your operating system, choose the appropriate tab below for installation instructions.

Note that these steps are just required for development - your Fyne applications will not require any setup or dependency installation for end users!

<div id="install__windows" class="hidden">
<div style="text-align: left" markdown="1">

1. Download Go from the [download page](https://golang.org/dl/) and follow instructions
2. Install one of the available C compilers for windows, the following are tested with Go and Fyne:
    * MSYS2 with MingW-w64 - [msys2.org](https://www.msys2.org/)
    * TDM-GCC - [tdm-gcc.tdragon.net](https://jmeubank.github.io/tdm-gcc/download/)
    * Cygwin - [cygwin.com](https://www.cygwin.com/)
3. In Windows your graphics driver will already be installed, but it is recommended to ensure they are up to date.

The steps for installing with MSYS2 (recommended) are as follows:
* Install MSYS2 from [msys2.org](https://www.msys2.org/)
* Once installed do not use the MSYS terminal that opens
* Open "MSYS2 MinGW 64-bit" from the start menu
* Execute the following commands (if asked for install options be sure to choose "all"):

        $ pacman -Syu
        $ pacman -S git mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain

* You will need to add /c/Program\ Files/Go/bin and ~/Go/bin to your PATH, for MSYS2 you can paste the following command into your terminal:

        $ echo "export PATH=$PATH:/c/Program\ Files/Go/bin:~/Go/bin" >> ~/.bashrc

<div id="install__macos" class="hidden">
<div style="text-align: left" markdown="1">

1. Download Go from the [download page](https://golang.org/dl/) and follow instructions
2. Install Xcode from the [Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12)
3. Set up the Xcode command line tools by opening a Terminal window and typing the following:
    `xcode-select --install`
4. In macOS the graphics drivers will already be installed.

<div id="install__linux" class="hidden">
<div style="text-align: left" markdown="1">

* You will need to install Go, gcc and the graphics library header files using your package manager, one of the following commands will probably work.
* **Debian / Ubuntu:**
`sudo apt-get install golang gcc libgl1-mesa-dev xorg-dev`
* **Fedora:**
`sudo dnf install golang gcc libXcursor-devel libXrandr-devel mesa-libGL-devel libXi-devel libXinerama-devel libXxf86vm-devel`
* **Arch Linux:**
`sudo pacman -S go xorg-server-devel libxcursor libxrandr libxinerama libxi`
* **Solus:**
`sudo eopkg it -c system.devel golang mesalib-devel libxrandr-devel libxcursor-devel libxi-devel libxinerama-devel`
* **openSUSE:**
`sudo zypper install go gcc libXcursor-devel libXrandr-devel Mesa-libGL-devel libXi-devel libXinerama-devel libXxf86vm-devel`
* **Void Linux:**
`sudo xbps-install -S go base-devel xorg-server-devel libXrandr-devel libXcursor-devel libXinerama-devel`

<div id="install__android" class="hidden">
<div style="text-align: left" markdown="1">

* To develop apps for Android you will first need to install the tools for your current computer (Windows, macOS or Linux)
* Once complete you will need to install the Android SDK and Android NDK - the recommended approach is to install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html) and then go to **Tools > SDK Manager** and from **SDK Tools** install the **NDK (Side by side)** package.

</div>
</div>

<div id="install__ios" class="hidden">
<div style="text-align: left" markdown="1">

* To develop apps for iOS you will need access to an Apple Mac computer, configured according to the **macOS** tab above.
* You will also need to create an [Apple Developer account](https://developer.apple.com) and sign up to the developer program (costs apply) to obtain the necessary certificate to run your app on any devices.

## Downloading

When using Go modules (required with Go 1.16 and later), you will need to set up the module before you can use the package.
If you are not using modules or you already have your module initialized, you can skip this to the next step.
Run the following command and replace `MODULE_NAME` with your preferred module name (this should be called in a new folder specific for your application).

    $ cd myapp
    $ go mod init MODULE_NAME

You now need to download the Fyne module. This will be done using the following command: 

    $ go get fyne.io/fyne/v2

To finish your module's set up, you now need to tidy the module file to correctly reference Fyne as a dependency.
You do this by using the following command (can be skipped if you are not using modules):

    $ go mod tidy

If you are unsure of how Go modules work, consider reading [Tutorial: Create a Go module](https://golang.org/doc/tutorial/create-module).

## Run the demo

If you want to see the Fyne toolkit in action before you start to code your own application,
you can see our demo app running on your computer by executing:

    $ go run fyne.io/fyne/v2/cmd/fyne_demo@latest

Please note that the first run has to compile some C-code and can thus take longer than usual. Subsequent builds reuse the cache and will be much faster.

### Installing

If you want to, you can also install the demo using the following command (requires Go 1.16 or later):

    $ go install fyne.io/fyne/v2/cmd/fyne_demo@latest

For earlier versions of Go, you need to use the following command instead:

    $ go get fyne.io/fyne/v2/cmd/fyne_demo

If your `GOBIN` environment has been added to path (should be by default on macOS and Windows), you can then run the demo:

    $ fyne_demo

And that's all there is to it! Now you can write your own Fyne application in your IDE of choice. If you want to see some Fyne code in action then you can read [your first application](/started/firstapp).
