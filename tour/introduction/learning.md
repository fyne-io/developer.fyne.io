Fyne is designed to be easy to get started with and simple to build 
large applications across multiple platforms. It is also designed to
allow custom elements to be added and contributed.

Through this tutorial you will find topics that grow in complexity
but none should be beyond a proficient programmer. Every step of the
way you can copy the examples into your IDE and see them in action.

By the end of this tour you will know all of the building blocks
of Fyne and its tools. We can't wait to see what you build.

If at any point you want to start giving back we welcome contributions,
bug reports and conversations with people that are using the toolkit.
You can find more about contributing by visiting our
[contributors page](https://fyne.io/contribute.html) or 
[github repository](https://github.com/fyne-io/fyne/).

Please continue to our first tutorial "[Getting Started](/tour/basics/)".
