A `fyne.Widget` is a special type of container that has additional logic
associated with it. In widgets the logic is separate from the way that
it looks (also called the `WidgetRenderer`).

Widgets are also types of `CanvasObject` and so we can set the
content of our window to a single widget. See how we create a new
`widget.Entry` and set it as the content of the window in this example.

As we saw in the previous example you can also add multiple objects
to a canvas using a `Container` and the same can be done with sets of
widgets to start building up graphical application interface.

Next take some time to learn about other "[Canvas Objects](/tour/canvas/)".
