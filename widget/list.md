The `List` widget is one of the toolkit's collection widgets.
These widgets are designed to help build really performant
interfaces when lots of data is being presented.
You can also see the [Table](/widget/table) and `Tree` widgets which have a
similar API. Because of this design they are a little more
complicated to use.

The `List` uses callback functions to ask for data when it is required.
There are 3 main callbacks, `Length`, `CreateItem` and `UpdateItem`. The Length callback (passed first) is the simplest,
it returns how many items are in the data to be presented. The
others relate to templates - how graphical elements are
created, cached and re-used.

The `CreateItem` callback returns a new template object. This
will be re-used with real data when the widget is presented.
The `MinSize` of this object will influence the `List` minimum size.
Lastly `UpdateItem` is called to apply an item of data to a
cached template. Use this to set the content ready for display.

```go
package main

import (
	"fyne.io/fyne/v2"
	"fyne.io/fyne/v2/app"
	"fyne.io/fyne/v2/widget"
)

var data = []string{"a", "string", "list"}

func main() {
	myApp := app.New()
	myWindow := myApp.NewWindow("List Widget")

	list := widget.NewList(
		func() int {
			return len(data)
		},
		func() fyne.CanvasObject {
			return widget.NewLabel("template")
		},
		func(i widget.ListItemID, o fyne.CanvasObject) {
			o.(*widget.Label).SetText(data[i])
		})

	myWindow.SetContent(list)
	myWindow.ShowAndRun()
}
```
